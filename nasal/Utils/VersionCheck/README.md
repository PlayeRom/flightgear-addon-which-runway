Canvas Skeleton Add-on
======================

## Version checker

The files in this directory are responsible for checking whether a newer version of the add-on has been released. This allows you to inform the user about it. There are 3 ways to check your version, of course you should only choose one.

### Method 1. MetaDataVersionChecker

The simplest method involves downloading the `addon-metadata.xml` file from your repository, which contains the add-on's version. Therefore, if you push a new commit to the server and increment the add-on's version, users can receive notification of the new version. The disadvantage of this solution is that releases are not used, so the version will always be loaded from a branch, such as master. Therefore, if you increment the version of an add-on that isn't quite ready, users will receive notifications.

The advantage is that it is a repository-independent solution, but it requires modifications to the `MetaDataVersionChecker.nas` file.

Requirements:

1. In the `addon-metadata.xml` file, in the `<code-repository>` field, place the full URL to your repository, e.g., `https://github.com/PlayeRom/flightgear-addon-canvas-skeleton`.
2. In the `MetaDataVersionChecker.nas` file, find the `_getUrl` method and adjust your branch name and repository URL there.
3. In `Bootstrap.nas` file use `g_VersionChecker = MetaDataVersionChecker.new();`.

### Method 2. GitHubVersionChecker

You can use this version checking method if you host your add-on on GitHub and use git tags to create releases.

1. In the `addon-metadata.xml` file, in the `<code-repository>` field, place the full URL to your repository, e.g., `https://github.com/PlayeRom/flightgear-addon-canvas-skeleton`.
2. In `Bootstrap.nas` file use `g_VersionChecker = GitHubVersionChecker.new();`.
3. Tags must be in version notation as accepted by the `<version>` field in the `addon-metadata.xml` file (see below). Optionally, you can prefix the version in the tag with "v." or "v".

### Method 3. GitLabVersionChecker

You can use this version checking method if you host your add-on on GitLab and use git tags to create releases.

1. In the `addon-metadata.xml` file, in the `<code-repository>` field, place the full URL to your repository, e.g., `https://gitlab.com/PlayeRom/flightgear-addon-canvas-skeleton`.
2. In `Bootstrap.nas` file use `g_VersionChecker = GitLabVersionChecker.new();`.
3. Tags must be in version notation as accepted by the `<version>` field in the `addon-metadata.xml` file (see below). Optionally, you can prefix the version in the tag with "v." or "v".

## Version notation for add-on

Add-on version in the `addon-metadata.xml` file must be written in one of the following format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH{a|b|rc}N
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH{a|b|rc}N.devM
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.devM
```

where `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`, `N`, `M` are integers. `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH` can be zeros, and `N`, `M` must be greater than 0.

The character `a` denotes alpha versions, `b` - beta, `rc` - release candidate, and each version can have the suffix `.devM`.

Examples from the smallest version to the largest:

```
1.2.5.dev1      # first development release of 1.2.5
1.2.5.dev4      # fourth development release of 1.2.5
1.2.5
1.2.9
1.2.10a1.dev2   # second dev release of the first alpha release of 1.2.10
1.2.10a1        # first alpha release of 1.2.10
1.2.10b5        # fifth beta release of 1.2.10
1.2.10rc12      # twelfth release candidate for 1.2.10
1.2.10
1.3.0
2017.4.12a2
2017.4.12b1
2017.4.12rc1
2017.4.12
```

## Version notation for git tags

The tag version assigned to releases should be the same as the add-on version. However, tag versions may be additionally marked with the prefix "v." or "v", for example: `v.1.2.5` or `v1.2.5`.

```

The `VersionChecker` class implements key elements, such as registering callbacks to inform other classes about the new version. It is inherited by `JsonVersionChecker` and `XmlVersionChecker`, which implement various methods for downloading resources from the web.

The `JsonVersionChecker` class can download any file from the internet and pass its contents (as text) to its child's callback function. This class also includes a JSON parser, as the most frequently downloaded resource will be a JSON file. This class uses the `http.load()` method to download the resource.

The `XmlVersionChecker` class implements XML file downloading as a `<PropertyList>`, a solution that only works with FlightGear. For this purpose, the `xmlhttprequest` fgcommand is used, and then it passes the `props.Node` object to its child's callback function, allowing navigation through the parsed XML.

The `MetaDataVersionChecker` class inherits from `XmlVersionChecker` because it downloads the `addon-metadata.xml` file from the add-on repository. This class's task is to determine the URL pointing to the file to download and to handle a callback function called `XmlVersionChecker`, which will receive a `props.Node` object with the parsed XML. The callback function retrieves the new version of the add-on as a string and passes it to the `me.checkVersion()` method.

The `GitHubVersionChecker` and `GitLabVersionChecker` classes inherit from `JsonVersionChecker` because they communicate with the appropriate service via API. The classes do similar things, only for other services hosting repositories. The purpose of these classes is to establish a URL pointing to the file to download and to handle a callback function called `JsonVersionChecker`, which receives a string as content in JSON format. The callback function retrieves the new version of the add-on as a string and passes it to the `me.checkVersion()` method.

If you need your own implementation for downloading a file, simply add a new class such as `MetaDataVersionChecker` or `GitHubVersionChecker`, where you specify the URL to the resource and implement a callback function that receives the downloaded resource and finally calls `me.checkVersion()`.

## How do I notify the user about a new version?

1. Make sure to create the correct instance of the class in the `Bootstrap.nas` file for the `g_VersionChecker` variable, depending on your version checking method.

2. Make sure that in the `Bootstrap.nas` file, after creating all class instances, the `g_VersionChecker.checkLastVersion();` method is called.

3. In the class created globally in `Bootstrap.nas`, where you want to inform the user about a new version, e.g. in the `AboutPersistentDialog`, register a callback that will be called if a newer version is available. For example in the `new` method, add:

    ```nasal
    new: func() {
        var me = {...};

        g_VersionChecker.registerCallback(Callback.new(me.newVersionAvailable, me));

        return me;
    },
    ```

    and write the `newVersionAvailable` method and in its body what you want to do with the information about the new version:

    ```nasal
    #
    # Callback called when a new version of add-on is detected.
    #
    # @param  string  newVersion
    # @return void
    #
    newVersionAvailable: func(newVersion) {
        # TODO: your implementation here...
    },
    ```

    You can register multiple such callbacks in your different classes, each of them will be called if a new version is available.

When creating objects at runtime, you can simply use the `g_VersionChecker.isNewVersion()` and `g_VersionChecker.getNewVersion()` methods to drive the logic of informing the user about the new version.

## Removing unnecessary files

If you choose to use the `MetaDataVersionChecker` method, the `GitLabVersionChecker.nas`, `GitHubVersionChecker.nas`, and `JsonVersionChecker.nas` files are unnecessary and you can remove them from the project to prevent them from being loaded unnecessarily. Alternatively, if you want to keep them, add them to the `_excluded` list in the `/Loader.nas` file.

Similarly, if you choose to use the `GitHubVersionChecker` class, the `MetaDataVersionChecker.nas`, `GitLabVersionChecker.nas`, and `XmlVersionChecker.nas` files are unnecessary.
